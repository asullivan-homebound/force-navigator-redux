# Fix Active Flow URL Construction Specification

- **User Story:** As a user, when I select an "Active Flow" from the command palette, I want the URL to be constructed correctly (absolute URL) so that it opens the Flow Builder successfully, instead of appending the target domain to the current page's URL (resulting in a 404).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - [ ] The "Active Flow" commands generated by `getActiveFlows` must have URLs starting with `https://`.
    - [ ] The generated URL should follow the format: `https://<domain>/builder_platform_interaction/flowBuilder.app?flowId=<FlowVersionId>`.
    - [ ] Verify that clicking an Active Flow command opens the correct page in a new tab or current tab (depending on modifier keys).
    - [ ] Ensure no regression for other commands (Objects, Users).

- **Technical Implementation:**

  - **`src/background.js`**:
    - Locate the `getActiveFlows` message handler.
    - Modify the `flowTargetUrl` construction.
    - Currently: `let flowTargetUrl = request.domain + "/builder_platform_interaction/flowBuilder.app?flowId="`
    - Change to: `let flowTargetUrl = "https://" + request.domain + "/builder_platform_interaction/flowBuilder.app?flowId="`
    - Ensure `request.domain` is treated as the host. If `request.domain` potentially contains `https://` (unlikely based on analysis but good to be safe), sanitize it or check before prepending. Use the `forceNavigator.serverInstance` logic as the source of truth which strips protocol.

- **Test Coverage:**
  - **Unit Tests:**
    - `getActiveFlows`: Mock the `request` object with a known domain (e.g., `test.lightning.force.com`) and verify the output URL in the response matches `https://test.lightning.force.com/builder...`.
  - **Manual Verification:**
    - Search for a flow in the palette.
    - Click it.
    - Check the address bar for the correct URL.
